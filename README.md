## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts
- Media Queries
- Responsively App

### What I learned

Although I was able to center the main card horizontally, it was a little tricky to get it centered vertically, even though I was using the appropriate Flexbox properties. Finally, I was able to get it centered vertically using the following CSS:

```css
.main-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  position: absolute;
  margin: auto;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

Although I was able to use media queries successfully to achieve what I needed to for this project, I want to focus on improving the way I use media queries in future projects.
